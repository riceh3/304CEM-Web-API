            <p>An ambitous problem solver with a passion for online businesses, and who would like to join a team of like-minded developers. 
                I have much experience of creating logical and innovative solutions to complex problems. I am thorough and precise in everything I do,
                    and have a keen interest in technology, mobile applications and user experience. As someone who takes responsibility for own personal development, 
                    I am continually evaluating and upgrading my skills so that I stay at the cutting edge of web development.</p>
