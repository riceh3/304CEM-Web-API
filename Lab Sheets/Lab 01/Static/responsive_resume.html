            <p>An ambitious problem solver with a passion for online businesses, and who 
                would like to join a team of like-minded developers. I have much
                experience of creating logical and innovative solutions to complex problems.
                I am thorough and precise in everything I do, and have a keen interest in
                technology, mobile applications and user experience. As someone who takes
                responsibility for own personal development, I am continually evaluating
                and upgrading my skills so that I stay at the cutting edge of web development.
